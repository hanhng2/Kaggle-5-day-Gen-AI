# Kaggle-5-day-Gen-AI
## Kaggle's 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course

 **Day 1**: Foundational Models & Prompt Engineering - Explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Get trained with the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.

**Day 2**: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases - Learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases, including embedding methods, vector search algorithms, and real-world applications with LLMs, as well as their tradeoffs.

**Day 3**: Generative AI Agents - Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.

**Day 4**: Domain-Specific LLMs - Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

**Day 5**: MLOps for Generative AI - Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.


## How the Course Works:

Everyday, you’ll receive an email with assignments. The assignments include an optional podcast episode, new whitepapers to read, and code labs.
While completing the assignments, you’ll be able to ask questions and discuss with other participants on our Discord channel. The channel will occasionally be monitored by several Google ML researchers and engineers who can answer questions.

Everyday, Paige Bailey will host a YouTube livestream at 11am ET/8 am PT starting on Monday, Nov 11th. She’ll be joined by special guests from Google. After the livestream, the recording will be shared on Discord

If you complete all of the code labs on Kaggle, by Friday, November 22nd you’ll receive a Kaggle badge on your profile!
